Experimental setup for reliably recreating System configurations


## Requirements
 - Mainly a repository to recreate the status of my basement server setup

## Disaster Recovery
While this is aimed at beeing the guide for restoring the server setup from an offsite backup this will also be a step by step guide for how to recover the server in case of catastrophic failure.
Writing this now with a cool mind instead of having to figure things out when actual shit hits the fan

1. Obtain a new computer running ubuntu to be the target for the backup restoration
2. ???
3. Profit?
